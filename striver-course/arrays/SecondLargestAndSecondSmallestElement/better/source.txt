Even though we want to have just the second smallest and largest elements, 
we are still sorting the entire array for that and thus 
increasing the time complexity. Can we somehow try to not sort the array 
and still get our answer?

Approach -> 

1. Find the smallest and largest element in the array in a single traversal
2. After this, we once again traverse the array and find an element that is just greater than the smallest element we just found.
3. Similarly, we would find the largest element which is just smaller than the largest element we just found


Time Complexity: O(N), We do two linear traversals in our array

Space Complexity: O(1)
