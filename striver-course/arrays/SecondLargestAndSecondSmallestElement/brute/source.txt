Assuming if the array doesn't have any duplicates elements in an array 

Approach is very simple here so basically if you have given the array and you have to find the second largest and second smallest element in an array 

1. You will simply sort the array in ascending order 
2. We know the first element is smallest - the next element is second smallest 
3. We know the last element is largest - the previous element is second largest 


Time Complexity: O(NlogN), For sorting the array
Space Complexity: O(1)
